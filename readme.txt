Ally Web Accessibility (formerly One Click Accessibility) enables you to include easy-to-set accessibility features that make your website more inclusive to visitors regardless of their abilities.

== Description ==

Ally Web Accessibility is a plugin aimed to help web creators design websites that align with global accessibility standards. With regulations like the European Accessibility Act set to take effect in 2025 - there is a growing shift towards a greater focus on accessibility.

Our Ally Web Accessibility plugin replaces the One Click Accessibility plugin and introduces a newly designed interface with an optimized editing experience.

=== It’s the Law

As accessibility standards continue to evolve and become mandatory, it’s important to start making website adjustments to comply with fast-approaching global regulations. Among its other capabilities, this plugin lets you instantly generate your website's Accessibility Statement, which is now mandatory in most locales.

The Ally Web Accessibility plugin is not a substitute for a thorough accessibility audit and is NOT intended to completely make your website legally compliant. However, with it, you’re one step closer to making your website inclusive to more visitors, including those with visual, auditory or cognitive challenges.

Ensuring that your website complies with all applicable accessibility requirements is your responsibility. We recommend working with qualified accessibility professionals to help achieve full compliance.

=== Why Prioritize Accessibility

Every user deserves a seamless online experience, regardless of their abilities. An accessible website isn't just ethical; it's good business. By prioritizing inclusivity, you improve user experience for everyone, boost your search engine rankings, and attract a wider audience.

=== Putting Your Visitors in Control

Accessible websites allow people with various disabilities to access your website using assistive technologies where visitors can adjust design elements to fit their needs, such as increasing font sizes, adjusting color contrasts, pausing animations, and more.
