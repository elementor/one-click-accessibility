Ally: Make your site more inclusive by scanning for accessibility violations, fixing them easily, and adding a usability widget and accessibility statement.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2ig5D348vo

Ally (formerly One Click Accessibility) is a free, powerful, and user-friendly plugin that helps WordPress creators build more accessible websites with ease.
It simplifies accessibility with three essential tools:

- **Ally Assistant** – Scan your pages, detect accessibility violations, and follow guided steps to fix them. Make manual adjustments or apply AI-powered suggestions, and track your progress.
- **Usability widget** – Let visitors personalize their browsing experience with a floating accessibility menu. Features include font resizing, color contrast, image hiding, animation pausing, language selection, screen reader support, and more.
- **Accessibility statement generator** – Create a fully customized accessibility statement and publish it automatically on your site, helping meet WCAG and legal requirements.

**No expertise required** -just activate, configure, and start making your site more inclusive today.Built by Elementor. Designed for every WordPress site. Ally is web accessibility—simplified.


=== Why does web accessibility matter?
- **Who Needs It?** Every website owner—businesses, creators, and agencies.
- **Who is Responsible?** Website owners are legally and ethically responsible for accessibility. The web creator—who designs and builds the site—must implement and adjust accessibility features to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines and provide an inclusive experience for all users.
- **Why Now?** Rising legal requirements (WCAG, EAA) and better user experience.
- **Why Should You Care?**  An accessible website isn't just ethical; it's good business. By prioritizing inclusivity, you improve user experience for everyone, boost your search engine rankings, and attract a wider audience.

=== It’s the Law

As accessibility standards continue to evolve and become mandatory, it’s important to start making website adjustments to comply with fast-approaching global regulations. Among its other capabilities, this plugin lets you instantly generate your website's Accessibility Statement, which is now mandatory in most locales.

The Ally plugin is not a substitute for a thorough accessibility audit and is NOT intended to completely make your website legally compliant. However, with it, you’re one step closer to making your website inclusive to more visitors, including those with visual, auditory or cognitive challenges.

Ensuring that your website complies with all applicable accessibility requirements is your responsibility. We recommend working with qualified accessibility professionals to help achieve full compliance.
